# <h1> Performance Analytics Dashboard </h>

#### Introduction:
<p>
  In 2022, I participated in our company's first-ever hackathon challenge, "Illuminating Statistics via Dashboard." 
  We were given a dataset and tasked with deriving insights from it. Fortunately, 
  I secured the first-place position by crafting an interactive and insightful microstrategy dashboard.
</p>
<p>
  However, the dashboard couldn't be shared publicly due to data-sharing issues and the need to protect company information. 
  To address this, I modified the data to ensure no sensitive company details were revealed. 
  In this project, I have replicated and further improved upon the dashboard that earned me the first-place award.
