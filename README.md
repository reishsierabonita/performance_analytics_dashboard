# <h1> 📈📊📉 Performance Analytics Dashboard </h>

#### 🙋‍♂️ Introduction:
<p>
  In 2022, I participated in our company's first-ever hackathon challenge, "Illuminating Statistics via Dashboard." 
  We were given a dataset and tasked with deriving insights from it. Fortunately, 
  I secured the first-place position by crafting an interactive and insightful microstrategy dashboard.
</p>
<p>
  However, the dashboard couldn't be shared publicly due to data-sharing issues and the need to protect company information. 
  To address this, I modified the data to ensure no sensitive company details were revealed. 
  In this project, I have replicated and further improved upon the dashboard that earned me the first-place award.
</p>

#### 📃 Project Scope:
<p>This project involved analyzing clients query data to identify trends, root causes, and opportunities to improve resolution times. The goal was to create an interactive dashboard to illuminate insights for leadership and process improvement teams to optimize workflows and enhance speed and quality of query resolution. In summary, the dashboard centralizes and visualizes key statistics to drive faster, more effective issue resolution.</p>

#### ⭐ Dashboard Features:
- Filters on teams, individuals and clients enable users to drill down into more granular performance insights. The filters provide the ability to analyze specific team, individual assignee and clients metrics in detail.
- The dashboard has interactive visualizations with cross-filtering functionality. Clicking on one chart filters the data in other charts.

#### 🤔 Who It's For:
The leadership team and process improvement teams can use this dashboard to identify opportunities for faster resolution and optimal processes by analyzing root causes, resolution times, trends, and top query-generating processes.

#### 💡 Key Insights:
- The team with the highest average working days to resolve queries was Dynamo at 16.14 days. The best performing team was Alloy at 8.29 days on average.
- The client with the longest average query resolution time was SmartTech Innovations at 12.42 days. The fastest was Quantum Systems Group at 8.97 days.
- Process-Linked (G) was the top root cause, averaging 41 days to resolve

#### 🏃‍♂️ Recommendations:
- Provide additional training/support for the Dynamo team, which takes the longest at 16.14 days on average.
- Consider workload balancing for top performers like Dynamo to assist other teams.
- Set up performance improvement plans for the bottom 3 clients by resolution time.
- Analyze trend of increasing monthly query volume and prepare capacity plans.
- Continue monitoring this dashboard for additional insights over time.

In summary, the dashboard shows opportunities to improve query response times, particularly for the poorer performing teams and clients. Addressing the process-linked root causes could also help reduce resolution times.
